How to update pages/chapters
Step 1: Upload page images into pages folder
Step 2: (recommended) Rename it [chapter]-[page]
Step 3: Go into the chapter html file. If making a new html file, make a copy of an older chapter.
Step 4: copy this -> <img class='page' src="pages/1-1.webp" /> and replace "1-1.webp" with the new name of the file. Repeat for every new page added
Step 5: Go into script.js and change the variable "maxChapter" to your new highest chapter number.
